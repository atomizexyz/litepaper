FENIX pays you to hold your own crypto
</p>

## Introduction

Since the birth of Bitcoin in 2009, counterparties have convinced investors to give them resource in exchange for the promise of secured funds and yield. Time and time again, we've seen these centralized counterparties fail. Failure modes include hacks, over leverage, insider trading, poor accounting, and opaque communication. Crypto was invented to get rid of middle men and remove counterparty risk. The FENIX protocol uses open source code on public blockchains to provide a [hyperstructure](https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html) that rewards crypto stakers for delayed gratification.

## Vision

FENIX is designed to reward crypto community members who believe in cryptos first principles of self-custody, transparency, trust through consensus, and permissionless value exchange without counterparty risk. FENIX's value is derived from the skills of the community members who have the freedom to assemble and create value for FENIX. Since no one party will own an outsized amount of the initial supply, it encourages the entire community to cooperate and coordinate. The FENIX token is minted by burning XEN, the fastest and most widely adopted token in crypto. XEN is a cross-chain protocol with a vision of onboarding as many users into crypto as possible.

## Features

**Equity**

FENIX compresses the resource gap in the XEN minting process. We believe in an equitable start which means that people should all have the opportunity to start at a similar place regardless of resources. This however does not mean that everyone will end the same ‚Äî Your end is based on your time bonus, size, self custody, sovereignty, and responsibly ending your stake.

**Time In Market**

FENIX expands XEN staking to a multi-generational time preference. We believe that value is built over long term time horizons. FENIX allows you to create daily or multi-generational stakes that can be passed to future generations.

**Penalty Redistribution**

FENIX rewards participants that manage their future stakes. FENIX also penalizes participants that don't do what they say they are going to do. The penalties are redistributed equally to honest participants.

#### Get Equity Tokens

FENIX uses the proof-of-burn function from XEN. To mint FENIX, burn XEN, the amount burned per address will determine the base FENIX supply which can be used for staking.

$$
base=\left(BurnedXEN\right)
$$

#### Stake Start

The stake start uses Time and Size bonus functions to calculate your equity stake in the pool (shares).

**Time Bonus:** The amplification a base stake's bonus compounding at 20% APY. The duration of a stake term is uncapped but there are penalties for ending early and ending late.

$$
\tau=base* \left(1 + 0.2 \right)^\frac{days}{365 days}
$$

**Size Bonus:** The amplification of a base stake's bonus using the natural log of the base rate. The size of a stake is uncapped but consolidating a stake yields more rewards.

$$
\sigma=ln(base)
$$

**Total Bonus:** The sum of the time and size bonus calculated upon starting a stake.

$$
\beta = \tau + \sigma
$$

**Shares:** The sum of the base FENIX plus the bonus FENIX

$$
shares = base + \beta
$$

#### Stake End

Ending your stake exists along two continuous functions. One function increases the percent of your stake before your target date and the other decreased the percent of your stake after your target date.

End a stake distributes the tokens into owner address address, while redistributing any penalties to the staking pool. This function can only be triggered by the owner of the wallet.

**End Early:** Ending a stake prematurely results in a penalty to the stake return. The longer the duration of a term is completed, the lower the penalty that is applied to that term. Lower penalties result in higher rewards.

$$
\epsilon=\left(shares\right) * \left(1\dfrac{blockTs - stakeTs}{term}\right)^2
$$

**End Late:** Ending a stake that is overdue results in penalties. The stake is penalized for 180 days until nothing is left. The penalty function is graceful that does not redistribute over 50% of your stake until day 143.

$$
\lambda=\left(shares\right) * 1-\left(\dfrac{lateDays}{180 days}\right)^3
$$

#### Defer

Acknowledge that the owner still has access but is not yet ready to receive tokens. This can be triggered by only once the stake term is completed.

## Glossary

**Terms**

- _base_ ‚Äî The base FENIX token used in a stake
- _ùûÉ_ ‚Äî (Tau/Time Bonus) The time bonus calculating for a stake. This bonus rewards a staker the longer longer delay gratification by issuing a bonus of `20%` APY every year.
- _ùõî_ ‚Äî (Sigma/Size Bonus) The size bonus calculation for a stake. This bonus rewards a staker more tokens based on the amount of tokens which are staked.
- _Œ≤_ ‚Äî (Beta/Total Bonus) The total bonus which is the sum of the time bonus and the size bonus.
- _ùù¥_ ‚Äî (Epsilon, Early Penalty) The penalty for prematurely ending a stake. The penalty is costs the staker the square of a served term.
- **_ùù∫_** ‚Äî (Lamda/Late Penalty) The penalty window for ending a stake. A staker will lose a percentage of total earnings over the course of 180 days. At the end of 180 day, the stake reward will be 0.
